After years of sharing ideas here and there, I wanted my own place, no platforms, no algorithms. 
Just a little corner of the web, in the spirit of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/).

So lo and behold: **My own personal website!**

I love tinkering with new tech, so I'm building it with **[Astro](https://astro.build/)**
for its clean developer experience (plus, the CLI robot won me over ðŸ¤–). 
Iâ€™m also exploring design more deeply, so Iâ€™m crafting the look and feel as I go.

**Hereâ€™s what you can expect to find around here:**

- Thoughts and reflections on software engineering, especially architecture and developer experience.
- Notes and stories from my journey as CTO at Jetdev. Iâ€™ll share what Iâ€™m learning, challenges Iâ€™m facing, and whatâ€™s shaping my perspective.
- Devlogs diving into my side projects and experiments. If Iâ€™m building or finding something cool, youâ€™ll hear about it.
- I am likely to also write some posts in French in this blog.

This blog will grow with me, so things will evolve.
