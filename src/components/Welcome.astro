      Hello there! I'm William, an entrepreneur and software architect who loves taking messy, complex problems and
      crafting them into clean, elegant solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m co-founder and CTO of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="orange"
                                   href="https://www.jetdev.fr">Jetdev</a>, where I spend my time designing systems,
      mentoring developers, and turning raw ideas into real products.
      I’ve been lucky to work with folks at Kiabi, Exotec, Decathlon, and Electro Depot, and I’ve also helped bring our
      own products <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="pink" href="https://www.scanzee.app/">Scanzee</a>
      and Distract to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love learning new things, then talking about them, sometimes in workshops, sometimes in talks, and sometimes
      just rambling on the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I’m not coding, you’ll usually find me button-mashing through a video game, nose-deep in a graphic novel, or
      trying new recipes with my wife.
      I also dabble in music and enjoy board games with friends.
    </p>
